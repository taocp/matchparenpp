Improves over standard matchparen.vim plugin by echoing line containing matching bracket in the status line so you can quickly see which block is terminated by this paren.  Also scans for braces/parens which are off-screen.

If you write functions or blocks like this:
if (condition)
{
    ...
}
the plugin will echo the line "if (condition)" and not the lone "{".
By default, the plugin scans the line containing the opening brace and the two lines above that, looking for the statement that begins the block, be it a loop or function definition.  If you want more or less, set it in the variable g:MP_stmt_thresh.

If you write functions or blocks like this:
void fooooooooooooooooo(int barrrrrrrrrrrrr, char *strange_isnt_it, double really_a_long_statement)
{
    ...
}
the plugin will echo the line "void fooooooooooooooooo(int barrrrrrrrrrrrr, char *strange_isnt_it, double really_a_long_...".
By default, the plugin echo the former part of the line and uses "..." to replace the back part of the line.
Otherwise, "Press ENTER or type command to continue" would happend.
If you want more or less, set it in the varibale g:matchparenpp_echo_length in ~/.vimrc.
By default, g:matchparenpp_echo_length = 85.
